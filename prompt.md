Using direnv and podman write a comprehensive development environment guide for python3.13 programming. Podman should use gentoo as the image. All python and development packages inside the container will be installed using portage. The python programming will make use of jupyter notebooks. Make sure the Containerfile will make use of the latest packages in the gentoo image. Also make sure the Containerfile allows the creation use flags per package as custom buildflags using /etc/portage/env. I also need to setup use flages for the gentoo image. Podman should use the host zsh configuration. Write the output in a nicely formatted and readable markdown output.
